PICO C3 IOT Project
====================

# Characteristics
The project will have deep sleep capabilities so it can save power.

The project will connect to the wifi so it can send to a local server the readings of the sensors.

The project will have temperature, humidity and pressure sensors connected via i2c.

The battery will be charged via a solar panel so in light hours it will be working using the solar energy, and in night time it will use the battery.
